I. Limitations
    A. Instructor
        1. Does not know how to ignore first name:
            e.g. regex will capture Dr. John for Dr. John Smith

II. Schedule Making plan
    A. Reads date then puts that into a array
    B. reads assignment following it and puts that into an array

III. Further Work
    A. Need to find a way to include more college majors
    B. If dates appear twice it messes up algorithm
        1. Although in syllabi that doesn't really happen right?
